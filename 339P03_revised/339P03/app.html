                <br>
                <p>Ever since I could remember, my parents would take my brother and I on trips. It wasn’t until I traveled recently with my friends that I realized how much thought and organization that went into planning a trip let alone with other people with different itineraries in mind. We ended up having to download and use different platforms to plan out the group itineraries, list out addresses and split expenses.</p>
            
                <br>
                <p>My friend Jericho approached me with the idea of creating an app that combined every aspect of travel planning to make people feel more at ease when it comes to the stresses of traveling. We thought that by designing a very intuitive and simple app, group travel planning would be stress-free to get everyone on the same page, literally. We used figma to create low-fidelity and high-fidelity, detailed mockups of interfaces and Jericho used react.js to create the application. </p>

                <h1>Packing is hard.</h1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Last minute packing is a very common dilemma and we are constantly thinking about what we need to pack and if we’re missing anything. My goal was to create a shared packing list function that would actually be meaningful and wouldn't be neglected by users.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Using Figma I created low-fidelity mockups with what I thought to be essential elements that would be needed for the packing list. Then I simplified these mockups using our chosen colour palette to create the high fidelity mockups.</p>

                <br>
                <p>As minds are scrambling to make sure we have everything we need, there’s things that we need to buy sometimes in order to be fully prepared for trips abroad. Realistically for trips abroad, not everyone owns everything and there are crucial niche items that we need to buy ahead of time while we are packing. </p>
                <br>
                <p>I originally thought about a button to place beside the item for users to click in order for the item box to be highlighted as a visual indicator that the item needs to be bought. After reaching out to other designers for feedback, I realized that the item bar felt too cluttered and created an accessible “quick view” function with very limited editing abilities. We were able to keep the essential elements in the main view of the list while providing them options of getting all functions.
