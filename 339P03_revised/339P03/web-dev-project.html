                <h1>I was not a coder.</h1>
                <br>
                <p>For context, my practice has mainly been in design and I was not the strongest coder to begin with. When my prof assigned this project, I was intimidated because of my limited ability of coding in HTML, CSS and JS.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="project-context">
                <h1>Define functioning*</h1>
                <br>
                <p>The project required us to create a mostly functioning website where users were able to go through the entire purchasing process, learn more about the company and products. However with a short timeline, we were not required to code proper add to cart functions and or visual indications for input errors. </p>

                    <h1>I like things organized.</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>The original code had everything referenced back to do one css file which was a lot to read through to make edits. To eliminate this problem for my fellow collaborators, I created different css files and compiled them under the same css folders and organized and placed the CSS code according to its functionality. </p>

                <h1>Exploring other pages should be easy.</h1>
                <br>
                <p>I created different pages with buttons that would direct the user back to other pages in the website. Ideally, companies want users to stay on the website after major points of interaction, it shouldnâ€™t not end after the purchase. Using CSS and HTML, I created pages with specific buttons that would entice users to further explore the site rather than relying that functionality on the navigation bar. </p>
                
                <br>
                <p>I also used a flexbox method to ensure that the buttons would show up in a top-down order instead of a side-by-side view when the page was accessed on a smaller device. </p>

                <h1>I understand code.</h1>
                <br>
                <p>While the project was merely based on the ability to code rather than mainly design, I was able to understand the role of web developers in bringing a design into fruition. While I can code, as product designer it was important to realize the importance of collaboration especially within a team with different abilities. To understand the different roles is an important realization to have when it comes to designing projects and to adapt those designs for both  users and developers. </p>
